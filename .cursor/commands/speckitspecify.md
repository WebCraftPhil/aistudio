Outline the “what” and the “why” of your project. This is what will be used to bootstrap the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your project, feature, or change. This step explicitly excludes technical decision making – you’re not defining the tech stack but rather focus on motivations and functional requirements.

## What
The "what" section should describe the project, feature, or change in detail. It should include:

1. **Project Overview**: A brief description of the project, its purpose, and its scope.
2. **User Stories**: Detailed descriptions of the users and their needs, including personas and scenarios.
3. **Functional Requirements**: A list of the specific functionalities that the project, feature, or change should provide.
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the system, such as performance, security, and usability.

## Conclusion
The "what", "why", and the "how" of your project. This is what will be used to bootstrap the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your project, feature, or change. This step explicitly excludes technical decision making – you’re not defining the tech stack but rather focus on motivations and functional requirements.
